## #Loading the style-guide
Open the command line on your system and make sure you have the folder the guide is in open (.\style-guide-template-parcel\style-guide-template\). 
Then type the following commands:

npm install
npm run start

This will create a temporary new directory, called /build/. It will also launch a webserver where you can see the style-guide project at as well. (typically: http://localhost:1234/)
